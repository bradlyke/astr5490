The code for this homework assignment is relatively self-contained.
It does require the two data tables to run, which are included with the program.
It requires pandas for data table processing, but this should come with the
lastest Anaconda3 installs (and already exists on Chip's machines).

Requires python 3 to run.

Run the program with the following command (if the data tables are in the same folder):

python hw3_read_exo_csv.py
